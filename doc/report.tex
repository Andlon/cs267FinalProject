\section{Project Description}
%What is a variogram, its application, why not yet parallel, comparison to particle simulation
%Note on how this will actually be used in research
%How we tested for correctness

\section{Implementations}
%Overview of different implementations and their goals 
%Any assumptions we made for all?
  \subsection{Serial}
  %Brief description
  %pseudo-code
  %Expected performance
  \subsection{Naive MPI}
  %Brief description
  %pseudo-code
  %Expected performance
  \subsection{Communication Optimal}
  %Brief description
  %pseudo-code
  %Expected performance
  \subsection{Computation Optimal}
 %Brief description
  %pseudo-code
  %Expected performance
\section{Results}
  %Plot of n versus time for all implementations
  %Effect of tuning parameters (how many copies?)
  %Extrapolation of how long my data set would take with each?
  %Actual result for my data set

\section{Conclusion}
%Which implementation(s) worked best? Always the case?
%What can be learned from the results to my dataset
%How this can be made more general (for future applications)
%Can now fit models and make simulations (for which algorithms already exist)
