Here we discuss the naive serial implementation for a two-dimensional empirical variogram calculation in order to introduce the concept. 

\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \KwData{A list of data points with their field value and coordinates}
 \KwResult{Distance bins with associated semivariance}
 Read data from file\;
 Initialize semivariance $\gamma[]$ and point counter $count[]$ arrays to zero\;
 \ForAll{point pairs}{
  Calculate Euclidean distance between points in pair\;
  Determine appropriate distance bin $bin$\;
  Calculate squared difference in points' values $sqdiff$\;
  Add the squared difference to the appropriate semivariance bin $\gamma[bin] \mathrel{+}= sqdiff$\;
  Increment the pair count for the appropriate bin $count[bin] \mathrel{+}= 1$\;
 }
 Average the squared differences by pair counts $\gamma[bin]  \mathrel{/}= 2count[bin]$\;
