We tried both a communication and computational optimal implementation for our empirical variogram calculation. We saw that the computational optimal implementation was better suited for our application given that computation was a greater burden than communication. We extrapolated that the large data set (see Figure~\ref{fig:herten}) would take one minute on 10 nodes (240 processors), which allows for a feasible application of our implementation in geostatistical analysis of the data set, which before now was not possible. Now that the empirical variogram of this data set can be calculated, it can have a variogram model fitted to it and random fields can be generated fitting the same spatial pattern of the geological heterogeneity, allowing for more accurate groundwater models. This code will be used for future research involving this large data set. 

Additional variogram features will be added, for example directional variograms. Currently, an 'omni-directional' variogram is calculated by our code because it does not consider the angle between the points, only the distance. The modification would include calculating sines and cosines for each pair based on the differences of the coordinates of the points in the pair. The result of the program would be the current $\hat{\gamma}(h)$ plus subsets of it like $\hat{\gamma}_x(h)$ which would only include pairs of points that are within a specified tolerance angle of the x-plane, called a 'direction' variogram. Another feature would be supporting three-dimensional fields. Our 10 test cases were all two-dimensional because the \texttt{gstat} package has known bugs for three-dimensional data and could not be used a reference for correctness. The only modification we need in our code to support three-dimensional data is to read in an additional column from the file and add a third dimension to the distance calculation. The algorithm itself will not change because all unique pairs will still be considered, but subsets of them will also be considered in the directional variograms. 

%%maybe mention how we could improve the file reading?
